# Novel Writer Agent

An autonomous AI agent that writes one page of a novel daily, inspired by real-world factors like mood, world news, and authentic writer influences. This agent creates compelling fiction by analyzing current events, emotional patterns, and literary styles to produce consistent, engaging narrative content.

## Overview

The Novel Writer Agent is a creative AI system that functions as an autonomous book author, crafting original fiction with daily consistency. It draws inspiration from multiple real-world sources to create authentic, emotionally resonant storytelling that evolves with current events and human experiences.

## Key Features

- **üìö Daily Writing**: Automatically generates one page of novel content every day
- **üåç World News Integration**: Incorporates current events and global happenings into narrative themes
- **üòä Mood Analysis**: Adapts writing style and tone based on emotional and atmospheric factors
- **‚úçÔ∏è Writer Inspiration**: Emulates authentic writer behaviors, routines, and creative processes
- **üìñ Narrative Consistency**: Maintains character development and plot coherence across daily entries
- **üé® Style Adaptation**: Evolves writing style based on genre, mood, and thematic requirements

## How It Works

The agent operates on a daily cycle:

1. **Morning Analysis**: Scans world news, weather, and cultural events
2. **Mood Assessment**: Analyzes current emotional and atmospheric conditions
3. **Creative Synthesis**: Combines real-world inputs with ongoing narrative threads
4. **Daily Writing**: Generates one page (~250-300 words) of novel content
5. **Story Continuity**: Updates character arcs and plot progression
6. **Archive & Reflect**: Saves the day's work and prepares for tomorrow's inspiration
